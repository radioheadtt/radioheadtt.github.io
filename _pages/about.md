Welcome to my Home Page. I'm a fourth year undergraduate student at the University of Science and Technology of China, majoring in Probability and Statistics.  My research interests lay broadly in high-Dimensional statistics, information geometry, network analysis, and latent factor models. I am applying the Ph.D. programs in 2023 Fall. Good luck to me!
